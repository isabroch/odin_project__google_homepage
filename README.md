# Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

## What is this project?
This project's goal is to recreate the styling of the Google homepage through HTML and CSS. Using the developer tools of my browser was encouraged.

Optionally, the Google search results page can also be created.

This project can eventually be published online via Github Pages and, when done, will be linked to in this readme document.
