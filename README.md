# Google Homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

## What is this project?
This project's goal is to recreate the styling of the Google homepage ([this cached page is the reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/)) through HTML and CSS. Using the developer tools of my browser was encouraged.

Optionally, the [Google search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage) can also be created.

This project can eventually be published online via Github Pages and, when done, will be linked to in this readme document.
